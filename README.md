Final Project:

•Wrote a C program to control a fan to turn on/off automatically at a certain temperature.
•The program uses I2C protocol to read the data through the sensor and shows the temperature value on an LCD display.
•The program allows users to press a button to send PWN signals to motor driver which changes the fan's speed.
